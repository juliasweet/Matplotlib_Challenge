# Matplotlib_Challenge
This is my Matplotlib homework, the Pyber assignment.

I recieved some guidance from my tutor, Brent Hillern. 
I also consulted Stack Overflow and the Matplotlib documentation. 

I made a handful of design and content decisions that deviated somewhat from the sample. 

For instance, I reorganized the pie charts so that the rural wedge sat below the suburban wedge. I hoped to place greater emphasis on the wedges that were relatively larger. 

Additionally, I added some elements that were not part of the original assignment, including a version of the scatter plot with trend lines. I'm very glad that I did, as my initial analysis of the data was incorrect.
